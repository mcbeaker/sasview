The set of routines that comprise this CORFUNC module were originally written 
in 1994 at the behest of Anthony (Tony) Ryan by Thomas (Tom) Nye whilst an 
undergraduate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, and are 
based on the earlier work of Gert Strobl (Universität Freiburg) and co-workers 
in the 1980's. The polydispersity analysis was proposed later by Guy Eeckhaut 
(ICI).

The original UNIX source was ported to the Windows environment (and given 
a Java GUI) as part of Collaborative Computational Project #13, funded by the 
UK Biotechnology & Biological Sciences Research Council and Engineering & 
Physical Sciences Research Council, by CCP13 Post-Doctoral workers Richard 
Denny and Mark Shotton in 1999.

The alternative Hilbert transform (volume fraction profile) analysis of 
Trevor Crowley (Salford University) and co-workers was suggested by Stephen 
(Steve) King (ISIS Facility). Its incorporation was started by CCP13 Post-
Doctoral worker Matthew Rodman and finally implemented in 2004 by Steve King 
and Damian Flannery (ISIS Facility), with help from Richard Heenan (ISIS 
Facility).

CORFUNC performs correlation function analysis of one-dimensional SAXS or SANS 
patterns, or generates a model-independent volume fraction profile from a 
one-dimensional SANS pattern from an adsorbed layer of polymer or surfactant.
